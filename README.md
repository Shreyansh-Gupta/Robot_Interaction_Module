Project Name: Robot Interaction Module <br> 
Author Name: Siddhant Sinha <br>
Project Date: March 2020 <br> 


I Wrote this code to be used by a robot for interacting with humans.

Modified nltk.chat.util module [Open source] to suit my needs.

nltk.chat.util is a chatting service.

I modified the module by adding my own response pairs [according to the needs of the robot], along with some more tweakings here and there.

Then I added a voice input feature.

So, upon activation the robot will listen and then convert it to text. It'll the perform a pattern matching using the modified code of (nltk chat).

Lastly, a response will be returned which is converted back to audio.
